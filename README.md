# Playtesting Instructions
1. Download the game file found in the Build folder that matches your system architecture. Note that only Windows devices are currently supported.
2. Begin a screen recording, preferrably something that records your screen as you play and your reactions through the camera and microphone. This will help me better understand how players interact with the game. I suggest [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) if you do not have something else you already use.
3. Run the downloaded game file.
4. Play the game to completion. The game title will be shown at the end.
5. Stop your recordings and upload them somewhere you can share a link or two to them.
6. Navigate to https://forms.office.com/r/LYm1BML4Wt and fill out the survey. Be sure to include links to your recording(s).
