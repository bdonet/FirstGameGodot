# Playtesting Instructions
1. Find the latest release and view its assets.
2. Download the game file that matches your system architecture. Note that only Windows devices are currently supported.
3. Begin a screen recording, preferrably something that records your screen as you play and your reactions through the camera and microphone. This will help me better understand how players interact with the game. I suggest [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) if you do not have something else you already use.
4. Run the downloaded game file. Windows Defender may block the app at first, but go ahead and run it anyway. I haven't figured out how to officially publish the file yet.
    1. If the game does not run on your machine, open an [issue](https://github.com/bdonet/FirstGameGodot/issues). Please include your machine stats (OS version, CPU, and GPU) in the issue.
5. Play the game to completion. The game title will be shown at the end.
6. Stop your recordings and upload them somewhere you can share a link or two to them.
7. Navigate to https://forms.office.com/r/btdpdgF7ub and input the link to your recording(s).
8. Navigate to https://forms.office.com/r/LYm1BML4Wt and fill out the anonymous gameplay feedback survey.
